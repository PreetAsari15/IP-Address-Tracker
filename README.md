##### Steps to use the app

  1. In order to view the IP address of your current location, press the button without adding any information
  2. To track the location using IP address, simply enter the IP address in the input section and the press the button right next to it.
  
##### Tools used to build this app are:

```
Leaflet
Mapbox
Vue JS
Tailwind CSS
```

##### Ongoing bug fixes
The map must also change it's position when a request of IP address is sent, which is not the case at the moment. Please let me know if there's a mistake I'm making in my code. Thanks!
